## How to install

We strongly suggest the use of ruby version manager aka rvm, to install paste the following in your terminal: 

``` bash
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

* Clone this repository in your terminal: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/armandfardeau/slashershare.git
```

* Enter the directory:

```bash
cd slashershare
```

* Ensure you have the requested ruby version :

```bash
ruby -v
```

if it's ruby-2.4.2 you're good to go! 
else, install the requested version with rvm:

```bash
rvm install ruby-2.4.2
rvm use 2.4.2
ruby -v
```
If the output is ruby-2.4.2 you can move to the next section.

* install dependancies
```bash
bundle install --without production
```

* Make migration
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

* Start rails server
```bash
rails s
```
